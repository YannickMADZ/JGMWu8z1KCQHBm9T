# Talent Sourcing and Management - Candidate Ranking System

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-powered pipeline to automate talent sourcing and candidate ranking for technology roles. The system addresses key challenges in identifying suitable candidates by analyzing available profile information and generating fitness scores to prioritize potential hires.

## Problem Statement

Traditional talent sourcing involves significant manual effort across three key areas:
- Understanding client requirements and role specifications
- Identifying what makes a candidate suitable for specific roles
- Locating talented individuals efficiently

This solution aims to automate candidate evaluation and ranking while enabling continuous improvement through feedback mechanisms.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Candidate Fitness Prediction**: Machine learning models that assess candidate suitability based on profile data
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Automated ranking of candidates by fitness scores for given roles
- **Dynamic Re-ranking**: Real-time reordering of candidate lists based on user feedback
- **Keyword-based Search**: Support for role-specific keyword queries (e.g., "full-stack software engineer", "aspiring human resources")

### Interactive Capabilities
- **Starring System**: Mark ideal candidates to provide supervisory signals
- **Adaptive Learning**: Model refinement based on human feedback
- **Bias Mitigation**: Automated procedures to reduce human bias in candidate selection

## Technical Approach

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- Feature engineering from candidate profiles
- Predictive modeling for fitness scoring
- Ranking algorithms optimized for talent sourcing
- Continuous learning from user interactions

### Re-ranking Mechanism
- Real-time model adjustment when candidates are starred
- Improved ranking accuracy with each user interaction
- Preservation of ranking quality across different roles

### Filtering & Optimization
- Automated candidate filtering to remove irrelevant profiles
- Dynamic cut-off determination for candidate qualification
- Cross-role applicability without losing high-potential candidates

## Usage

### Input
- Candidate profiles with anonymized personal information
- Role-specific keywords for targeted searches
- User feedback through candidate starring

### Output
- Ranked candidate lists by fitness probability (0-1)
- Continuously improved rankings based on feedback
- Filtered candidate pools with quality assurance

## Success Metrics
- Accurate fitness prediction and candidate ranking
- Improved ranking quality with user feedback
- Effective filtering of unsuitable candidates
- Robust performance across different roles
- Reduced manual review time and human bias

## Future Enhancements
The system provides a foundation for exploring additional automation features and bias reduction techniques to further streamline the talent sourcing process.
